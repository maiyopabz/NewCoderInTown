# New Coder in Town - course site.

 `HTML` ,`CSS` and `Bootstrap5`.

Simple overview of use/purpose.

## Description 

I started with a simple `navbar` with a bg-dark color and sticky-top attributes. Along with it
I set the `button` toggler with a collapse attribute for mobile first. 

I declared a couple section-tags in the body to hold diffrent content.
a. Showcase
b. News Letter
c. Class Type Columns
d. Learn Section
e. Accordion
f. Intructor Columns

Im still currently building more section. I will update more soon.
